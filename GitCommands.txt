Git branch <name> - creates a branch which is different from the master branch, containing
	the original file with all the latest content. Used to make edits
Git checkout <name> - Directs you to the new branch where you can make new changes or 
	create new files
Git merge <name> - this will merge one branch onto another, which includes the master
	branch. After this, an add, commit, and push should follow
echo /*My system test2*/> textFile.txt - this will create a new text file, essentially 
	just creating a file with the extension specified
cat textFile.txt- this is concatinating the file and presenting the content of that
	file
.\textFile.txt - opens the txt file, useful for editing in a branch file
